MICROSERVICES:

-> Microservices is an approach of developing single application as a suite of small services, each running on its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisma, built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery.

HOW TO BUILD MICROSERVICES:

-> When considering a web application, the traditional approach involves packaging it as a WAR or EAR file. 
-> These archive formats are commonly used to bundle JAVA applications, which are then deployed to web servers like Tomcat or application servers like WildFly.
-> This is extremely challenging and practically impossible task.

Why Spring Boot For Microservices?

-> Spring Boot is a framework that simplifies the development and deployment of Java applications, including Microservices. 
-> With Spring Boot, you can build self-contained, executable JAR files instead of the traditional WAR or EAR files.
-> These JAR files contain all dependencies and configurations required to run the microservice. 
-> This approach eliminates the need for external web servers or application servers.

-> Provides a range of built in features and integrations such as auto-configuration, dependency injections, support for various cloud platforms.
-> Provides an embedded Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow server which can run the microservice directly without the need for a separate server installation.
-> Inbuilt support of production ready features such as metrics, healthchecks and externalized configuration. 
-> We can quickly bootstrap a microservice project and start coding with range of starter dependencies that provide preconfigured settings for various components such as databases, queues etc.
-> Well-suited for cloud-native development. It integrates smoothly with cloud platforms like Kubernetes provides support for containerization and enables seamless deployment to popular cloud providers.

-> In the traditional approach, applications are typically packaged as WARs and rely on the presence of a server in the execution environment for running. However, in the microservices paradigm, applications are packaged as self-contained JARs, also called as FAT jars or uber JARs since they contain the application itself, the dependencies and the embedded server.
